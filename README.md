# Panzer
Panzer, forked from Trilinos package of Panzer, is a toolkit that provides a multiphysics assembly engine for solving large-scale systems of partial differential equations. The original panzer package is far from completed. There are some defectives both in its implementation and design. For example
- Current implementation only allows one type of element in one application
- Second order time derivatives are not considered.  

are vital drawbacks from the point of view of its application.

Those problems are supposed to be solved in current package.
